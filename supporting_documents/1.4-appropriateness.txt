The component-based testing applied to the ML model showed that the deep learning model implemented in
the face_recognition library is more suitable for the software than classifier models.

More importantly, when integrating both the tagging and recognizing units, the integration test was
appropriate to detect a major defect. Different photos were used, but as boundary values, a photo that 
includes two faces close to each other was used, and the faces are distant from the camera which makes
them appear small. The defect was that during the tagging unit when fitting the model, the model stores
a cropped face from the photo to keep only the required face features in its database. The software could
tag the two faces but could not recognize one of them afterwards.

Going back to tagging the photos, it was found that the square around the face that shows the face being
detected is saved along with the face which takes a small part of the image. However, in this very
boundary value, the face became too small, and not full, to be detected.
