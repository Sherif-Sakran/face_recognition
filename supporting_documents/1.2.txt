Functional requirements:
- The software is capable of detectig the faces found in photos.
- The user can tag one or more of the detected persons to let the model learn about them for future face
recognition purposes, and any created files should be kept in a separate directory within the environment.
- The software stores the data entered in a general metadata file and in a separate file.
- The software would recognize the known faces in a given set of photos.
- The GUI application displays the photos to be tagged or recognized.
- The software is not capable of modifying or removing any of the photos.

Non-functional requirements:
- Reliability: the recognition of faces should be done accurately
    • we may not accept correct predictions to reject other false predictions
- Usability: the GUI should be easy-to-use where the features should afford its functionalities
    • stick to known standards for the interface (buttons and entries)
- Speed: the recognition of faces in photos should take reasonable time
    • different ML models are to be tested (unit test)
- Installability: the environment should be installed easily without any need for a technical background
    • environment creation is to be done automatically

* The software is designed for this specific purpose to be used for organizing its digital archives
of photographs. However, the software could be used for any facial recognition purposes
with no or minor adjustments depending on the requirements.
